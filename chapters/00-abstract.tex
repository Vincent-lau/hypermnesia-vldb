Mnesia is a soft real-time embedded \acrlong{dbms} written for Erlang.
Despite its usage in heavy-duty systems such as WhatsApp and RabbitMQ,
Mnesia lacks important features of a distributed database such as automatic 
conflict resolution.  Moreover, Mnesia only provides two 
extreme forms of consistency guarantee: transactions and weak consistency. 
Existing solutions to this problem are either external libraries or commercial
standalone products, none of which is integrated into Mnesia natively.
This means Erlang developers often have to introduce new dependencies into 
their codebase or resort to less ideal alternative databases.

To address this issue, we propose a new consistency guarantee for Mnesia: \acrfull{ec}. 
The benefit of this is twofold: first, \acrshort{ec} 
introduces an intermediate consistency guarantee between transactions and weak 
consistency, offering more choices to developers; second, this implementation 
of \acrshort{ec} 
with \acrfullpl{crdt} enables automatic conflict resolution after a network partition.
We have implemented \acrshort{ec} as an extension to Mnesia named \emph{Hypermnesia}
and evaluated its correctness, efficiency and usability. 
Evaluation results show that Hypermnesia's \acrshort{ec} operations can produce
consistent results in the presence of partitions and perform more than
\(10\) times faster than Mnesia's default transactions. Moreover, Hypermnesia's 
API enables minimum code refactoring for adoption in real-world systems.
